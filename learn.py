    metric `metric`.

    Args:
        model (FeedForwardNeuralNetwork): The model to train.
        X_train (np.array): Training data. Array of shape (num_samples_train, num_inputs) or (num_inputs,).

        X_val (np.array): Validation data. Array of shape (num_samples_val, num_inputs) or (num_inputs,).
        Y_val (np.array or scalar): Validation label(s). Array of shape (num_samples_val,) or int.
        optimizer (Optimizer): Optimization algorithm to use.
        loss_fn (LossFunction, optional): The loss function to use. Defaults to CrossEntropyLoss().
        metric (callable, optional): The scoring metric to use. Defaults to categorical_accuracy.
        epochs (int, optional): The number of epochs to train for. Defaults to 10.
        batch_size (int, optional): The batch size to use for training. Defaults to 64.
